Summary of the DriverPass Project: DriverPass wanted to provide students with access to online practice exams and on-the-road training to better prepare them for driving tests. DriverPass wanted help in designing a system that can handle these needs. 

Something I did particularly well was address the specific business requirements of the system in the systems design. However, if I could choose one part of my work on these documents to revise, I would create UML diagrams that more acurately represented the stakeholders of the application. I interpreted the user’s needs and implemented them into the system design by creating a one-to-one correspondence between specific business requirements and system features. Tt is very important to consider the user’s needs when designing because the application is ultimately for them and their business needs. The company has commissioned talents to develop a specifc asset integral to the funcitoning of the business. This awareness overflowed into my approach of designing the software. In the future to analyze and design a system, I would speak more with the clients to better understand the stakeholders in the picture.
